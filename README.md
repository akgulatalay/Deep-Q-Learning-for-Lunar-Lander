# 🚀 Lunar Lander with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements a Lunar Lander simulation using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). Inspired by SpaceX's rocket landings, this AI agent learns to control a lander and successfully land it in a simulated environment.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
In this project, the agent uses reinforcement learning to master the complex task of landing a lunar module in the `LunarLander-v3` environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns through trial and error, leveraging DQN to improve its performance.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Environment:** OpenAI Gym (`LunarLander-v3`)
- **Key Concepts:** Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Learning, Experience Replay

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** A neural network with three fully connected layers.
- **Replay Memory:** Stores experiences to sample during training, improving learning stability.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy:** Balances exploration and exploitation.
- **Target and Local Networks:** Implements soft updates for stable learning.
